Sabanci University Course: Mobile Application Development
---
In this course, me and my team mate build whatsapp-like real-time message application. Application uses MongoDB to store user authentication information and their messages. Authentication use JWT token. Users can add other users, and create groups. In front-end, React Native and Expo is used. Although we learn many things about back-end development and micro-service system, more knowledge and practice needed for better front-end user interface.
